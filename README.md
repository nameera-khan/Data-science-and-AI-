The files in this repository are a part of my first semester modules. The coursework I had worked on in Semester 1 thus far.
1. Data analysis - an analysis on the travel patterns of the London population using the underground services. 
2. Regression - A regression model to show the current condition of the bridges using the 5 predictor variables which include categorical variables, where the target variable is the condition.
3. Convolution Architecture - The model consists of a single block that includes 10 convolutional layers and an MLP layer for computing coefficients. The output of the MLP layer is used to weight the output of each convolutional layer, followed by summing the outputs together.
- Each layer generates 128 output channels with a kernel size of 3, and padding of 1. Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalisation, max pooling with a kernel size of 2 and a stride of 2. Usage of kernel 2,2 for max pooling reduces the spatial dimensions in half. Followed by a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.1 where inputs would be randomly set to 0, and a ReLU activation function for the non-linearities.
- The MLP layer is implemented using PyTorch's nn.Sequential module. It consists of an average pooling layer, a flatten layer, two linear layers with ReLU activation, a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.1, and a final linear layer with 10 output units which where these coefficients are used to multiply with the corresponding convolutional layers.
- The backbone class includes the block and a classifier layer, which consists of MLP and activation layers. The network takes an input tensor and outputs a tensor with the specified number of classes; in this case, 10.
- The forward function of the backbone class passes the input tensor through the block to produce an output tensor, which is then passed through the classifier layer which consists of the spatial average pool at the input of the block for the 126 input channels into the classifier, to produce the final output tensor.
