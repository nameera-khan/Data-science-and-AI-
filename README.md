The files in this repository are a part of my first semester modules. The coursework I had worked on in Semester 1 thus far.
1. Data analysis - an analysis on the travel patterns of the London population using the underground services. 
2. Regression - A regression model to show the current condition of the bridges using the 5 predictor variables which include categorical variables, where the target variable is the condition.
